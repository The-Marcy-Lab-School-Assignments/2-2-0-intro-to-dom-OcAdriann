# Question
When would you want to use `.innerHTML` to create some new html, and when would you want to use `.createElement` and node updates?

# Answer
Ypu would want to use `.createElement` most of the time because it's safer to just create individual elements but if you have a bunch of HTML code that you want to add and you know it's safe, you would use `.innerHTML`
